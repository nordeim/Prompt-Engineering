Analysis Summary
---
Purpose: Create an optimal system prompt for a GPT-5-powered chatbot that teaches generative AI concepts to the general public and novices
Audience: General public with little to no technical background in AI
Recommended Edit Mode: transformational — creating a new system prompt from scratch based on best practices
Top 3 Priorities:
- 1. Ensure accessibility for non-technical audiences through simple language and analogies
- 2. Incorporate educational best practices for teaching complex concepts to novices
- 3. Apply GPT-5 specific prompting techniques for optimal performance
Key Risks / Red Flags:
- [FACT-CHECK REQUIRED: Current capabilities and limitations of various AI models]
- [POTENTIAL_HARM: Providing guidance on AI usage that could be misused]
Suggested Success Criteria:
- Readability ≤ Grade 8 (lower than standard to ensure accessibility)
- Passive voice < 10%
