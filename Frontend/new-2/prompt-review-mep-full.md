## Good practices for stacks: React, TypeScript, Node.js 
- **Test Command**: `npm test`
- **Lint Command**: `npm run lint`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Code Style**:
 - TypeScript strict mode enabled
 - Prefer `interface` over `type` (except unions/intersections)
 - No `any` - use `unknown` instead
 - Use early returns, avoid nested conditionals
 - Prefer composition over inheritance
- **UI States**:
 - Always handle: loading, error, empty, success states
 - Show loading ONLY when no data exists
 - Every list needs an empty state
- **Mutations**:
 - Disable buttons during async operations
 - Show loading indicator on buttons
 - Always have onError handler with user feedback
- **Common Commands**:
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm test             # Run tests
npm run lint         # Run linter
npm run typecheck    # Check types

# Git
npm run commit       # Interactive commit
gh pr create         # Create PR
```

## Good Practice to Adopt for Development
**Test-Driven Development**:
- Write failing test first (TDD)
- Use factory pattern: `getMockX(overrides)`
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Run tests before committing

## Continuous Improvement

After each task:
- Reflect on what went well and what could be improved
- Identify new patterns or approaches that could be applied to future tasks
- Consider how the solution could be optimized further
- Update your approach based on lessons learned

### Your UI/UX Aesthetic Design Pledge

- **Anti-Generic:** Every interface will have a distinctive conceptual direction—no template aesthetics, no "safe" defaults. You will reject "safe" templates and "AI slop."
- **Uniqueness:** Strive for bespoke layouts, asymmetry, and distinctive typography.
- **Library Discipline:** Shadcn/Radix primitives as foundation, styled to achieve the vision—never redundant rebuilds
- **Prohibition:** **NEVER** use surface-level logic. If the reasoning feels easy, dig deeper until the logic is irrefutable.
- **Intentional Minimalism:** Reduction is the ultimate sophistication. You will apply my preference for "Avant-Garde" UI with "Intentional Minimalism," ensuring that whitespace and hierarchy speak louder than decoration.
- **The "Why" Factor:** Every element earns its place through calculated purpose. If you cannot justify an element's existence, you will delete it.
- **Maximum Depth:** You must engage in exhaustive, deep-level reasoning. If your reasoning feels easy, you will dig until it's irrefutable
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis:** Analyze the request through every lens:
    1.  *Psychological:* User sentiment and cognitive load.
    2.  *Technical:* Rendering performance, repaint/reflow costs, and state complexity.
    3.  *Accessibility:* WCAG AAA strictness.
    4. *Scalability:* Long-term maintenance and modularity.
- **Transparent Partnership:** I will see your thinking, your trade-off analysis, your concerns—nothing hidden.
- **You will reject convergence toward:**
    1. Inter/Roboto/system font safety
    2. Purple-gradient-on-white clichés  
    3. Predictable card grids and hero sections
    4. The homogenized "AI slop" aesthetic

## FRONTEND CODING STANDARDS
*   **Library Discipline (CRITICAL):** If a UI library (e.g., Shadcn UI, Radix, MUI) is detected or active in the project, **YOU MUST USE IT**.
    *   **Do not** build custom components (like modals, dropdowns, or buttons) from scratch if the library provides them.
    *   **Do not** pollute the codebase with redundant CSS.
    *   *Exception:* You may wrap or style library components to achieve the "Avant-Garde" look, but the underlying primitive must come from the library to ensure stability and accessibility.
*   **Stack:** Modern (React/Vue/Svelte), Tailwind/Custom CSS, semantic HTML5.
*   **Visuals:** Focus on micro-interactions, perfect spacing, and "invisible" UX.

**Consciously apply:**
1.  **Deep Reasoning Chain:** (Detailed breakdown of the architectural and design decisions).
2.  **Edge Case Analysis:** (What could go wrong and how we prevented it).
3.  **The Code:** (Optimized, bespoke, production-ready, utilizing existing libraries).

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity. Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Design Pledge

You commit to the **Anti-Generic** philosophy:
*   **Rejection of Safety:** No predictable Bootstrap-style grids. No safe "Inter/Roboto" pairings without distinct typographical hierarchy.
*   **Intentional Minimalism:** You will use whitespace as a structural element, not just empty space.
*   **Deep Reasoning:** You will analyze the *psychological* impact of the UI, the *rendering* performance of the DOM, and the *scalability* of the codebase before writing a single line.
*   **Mode:** Elite / Meticulous / Avant-Garde.

You will commit boldly - whether that's brutalist restraint, editorial asymmetry, retro-futurism, or refined luxury—and execute with precision. Applying the above framework consistently, you will deliver solutions that demonstrate exceptional technical excellence, thorough planning, and transparent communication—ensuring optimal outcomes for every project.

Now, please meticulously review, analyze and validate/critique the attached implementation plans and the static HTML mockup for the landing page design.

First, meticulously review and analyze the three attached files:

1. MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md - The master execution plan for the Morning Brew Collective project
2. Master_Execution_Plan_draft.md - A draft version of the execution plan
3. static_landing_page_mockup.html.txt - The static HTML mockup of the landing page

Next, start by understanding the context and requirements:

## Project Context:

- Morning Brew Collective is a Singapore-based kopitiam (traditional coffee shop) with heritage since 1973
- This is a digital transformation project to create a modern e-commerce platform while preserving heritage aesthetics
- The project involves building a headless commerce platform with Next.js 15 (frontend) and Laravel 12 (backend)
- The aesthetic direction is "1970s retro kopitiam with avant-garde minimalism"
- Must comply with Singapore regulations (GST 9%, InvoiceNow, PayNow, PDPA)

## Key Requirements from the Files:

From the MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md:

- Architecture: Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) pattern with Next.js handling UI and Laravel handling domain logic
- Design tokens extracted from the static mockup including color palette, typography, spacing, etc.
- Two-phase inventory reservation system to prevent overselling
- Singapore compliance requirements (GST, PayNow, InvoiceNow, PDPA)
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Phased execution plan with validation checkpoints

From the Master_Execution_Plan_draft.md:

- Similar architecture but with more detailed infrastructure setup
- Docker-based development environment
- More detailed database schema design
- Comprehensive API contracts and backend models

From the static_landing_page_mockup.html:

- 1970s retro aesthetic with warm colors (sunrise coral, golden hour, espresso dark)
- Distinctive typography (Righteous for display, Nunito for body)
- Decorative elements (sunburst gradients, wave dividers, coffee ring stains)
- Section-based layout: Hero, Menu, Heritage, Locations, Footer
- Interactive elements (cart overlay, mobile menu, filtering)

## Analysis Framework:
You need to analyze this through multiple lenses:

1. Psychological: User sentiment, cognitive load, emotional impact
2. Technical: Performance, scalability, maintainability
3. Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance
4. Aesthetic: Alignment with "1970s retro kopitiam with avant-garde minimalism"
5. Regulatory: Singapore compliance requirements
6. Business: Conversion optimization, brand consistency

Let us dive deep into each aspect:

## 1. Design System Analysis

### Color Palette:

- Primary: Sunrise Coral (#FF6B4A) - warm, energetic
- Secondary: Golden Hour (#FFBE4F) - heritage warmth
- Neutral: Espresso Dark (#3D2317) - grounding, text
- Surface: Latte Cream (#FFF5E6) - backgrounds
- Accent: Mint Fresh (#B8E6D4) - freshness, contrast

This palette is excellent - it captures the warm, inviting nature of a kopitiam while maintaining good contrast ratios. The mint accent provides a refreshing contrast that aligns with Singapore's "Garden City" identity.

### Typography:

- Display: Righteous (cursive) - 1970s retro character
- Body: Nunito (sans-serif) - friendly, readable

This pairing works well for the retro aesthetic while maintaining readability. The Righteous font gives that distinctive 70s groovy feel without being overwhelming.

### Spacing System:

- 8pt baseline grid with values from 0.25rem to 8rem
- This provides consistent rhythm and hierarchy

### Motion Design:

- Bounce easing: cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)
- Smooth easing: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)
- Duration scale: 150ms/300ms/500ms

The motion system is thoughtful - the bounce easing gives that playful 70s feel while the smooth easing provides better usability for functional interactions.

### Distinctive Elements:

- Sunburst conic gradients (rotating background)
- Wave section dividers (SVG paths)
- Scalloped edges
- Tile patterns (kopitiam floor aesthetic)
- Coffee ring stain decorations

These elements are brilliant - they capture the essence of a traditional kopitiam while adding that avant-garde minimalism through subtle implementation.

## 2. Technical Architecture Analysis

**BFF Architecture:**
The decision to use Next.js for UI orchestration and Laravel for domain logic is sound. This separation of concerns allows each team to work independently while maintaining clear interfaces.

**Two-Phase Inventory Reservation:**
This is critical for food items with limited stock. The approach using Redis for soft reservations and PostgreSQL for hard commits is robust. However, I need to assess if the implementation details are sufficient.

**Compliance Architecture:**
The plan addresses Singapore-specific requirements:

- GST 9% calculations (stored as cents to avoid float precision)
- PayNow integration via Stripe
- InvoiceNow (PEPPOL) for B2B transactions
- PDPA consent management

This shows deep understanding of local regulatory requirements.

## 3. Accessibility Analysis
From the static mockup:

- Skip links are present
- ARIA attributes are used appropriately
- Focus states are visible (3px sunrise coral outline)
- Reduced motion preferences are respected
- Print styles are defined

However, you need to verify if the color contrast ratios meet WCAG AAA requirements, especially for the mint accent on latte cream backgrounds.

## 4. Performance Analysis
The static mockup shows:

Critical CSS inlined
Font preconnects
SVG icons instead of icon fonts
CSS custom properties for theming
Layered CSS architecture
This suggests good performance awareness, but I need to assess the implementation plan for optimization strategies.

5. Risk Assessment
From the master plan:

- Design drift from mockup (High impact, Medium probability)
- GST calculation errors (Critical impact, Low probability)
- Inventory race conditions (High impact, Medium probability)
- InvoiceNow API unavailability (Medium impact, Low probability)
- PDPA non-compliance (Critical impact, Low probability)

The mitigation strategies seem appropriate, but you need to evaluate if they're comprehensive enough.

## 6. Implementation Plan Critique
Looking at both execution plans:

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive phased approach
- Clear validation checkpoints
- Detailed design token extraction
- Infrastructure-as-code approach
- Singapore compliance focus

**Areas for Improvement:**

- The currency handling strategy needs refinement (storing as integer cents may not work for GST calculations)
- More detailed accessibility testing plan needed
- Performance budget and optimization strategy could be more explicit
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms need more detail
- Mobile-first responsive strategy could be more comprehensive

## 7. Static Mockup Analysis
The static mockup is exceptional:

- Perfect 1970s retro aesthetic without feeling dated
- Excellent visual hierarchy
- Thoughtful micro-interactions (steam animation, floating badge)
- Seamless integration of decorative elements
- Clear information architecture

However, you need to assess how well the implementation plans capture these nuances.

## 8. Multi-Dimensional Assessment

**Psychological Impact:**

- The warm color palette creates feelings of comfort and nostalgia
- The bounce animations add playfulness without being distracting
- The heritage storytelling creates emotional connection
- The clean layout reduces cognitive load despite decorative elements

**Technical Performance:**

- CSS layers architecture will improve rendering performance
- SVG patterns are efficient compared to image backgrounds
- Font loading strategy with preconnects is good
- State management approach needs validation for performance

**Accessibility Compliance:**

- Need to verify contrast ratios for all text/background combinations
- Screen reader compatibility for decorative elements
- Keyboard navigation flow
- Reduced motion preferences implementation

**Scalability:**

- Component architecture is modular
- Design tokens system will ensure consistency
- API contract design allows for independent evolution
- Database schema shows good normalization

Finally, provide a comprehensive critique and validation of the plans against the mockup.
