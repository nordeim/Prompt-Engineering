I wwant you to deeply analyze and reimagine a landing page for a Singapore-based cafe shop:
- Invoke nostalgia of the 1970s using styles from the provided HTML sample as design inspiration
- Use a more refreshing and cheerful color scheme - cheerful and warming like aromatic fresh coffee in the morning

Provided are two files:
- File 1: A static HTML mock-up with multiple files (index.html, js/, css/, service-worker.js)
- File 2: opus-1i.html which seems to be a single-file HTML implementation with inline styles

Please follow the specific "Meticulous Approach" operating procedure with multiple phases:
1. Request Analysis & Planning
2. Implementation
3. Validation & Refinement
4. Delivery & Knowledge Transfer

I've provided extensive research on 1970s aesthetics, color palettes, typography, and layout patterns. I want me to think deeper and harder, avoiding generic AI slop, and commit to an anti-generic design philosophy.

The key is to:
- Apply the meticulous approach thoroughly
- Create a conceptual direction called "Sunrise at the Kopitiam"
- Develop a color system called "Morning Brew Sunrise"
- Reimagine the landing page with 1970s Singapore kopitiam nostalgia
- Use cheerful, warm, refreshing colors
- Maintain full functionality and improve accessibility
-Deliver production-ready code

You need to follow the SOP structure precisely, showing your deep analysis, planning, validation checkpoints, implementation details, and comprehensive QA.

Let start by deeply analyzing the existing design and the requirements.
