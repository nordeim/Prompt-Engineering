Please meticulously review and analyze @new.html, then think deeper and think harder to reimagine the landing page for a Singapore-based small-to-medium cafe shop business with two key requirements:

Invoke nostalgia of the 1970s (using styles from the HTML sample as design inspiration)
Use a more refreshing and cheerful color scheme - cheerful and warming like an aromatic fresh coffee brew in the morning
Let me analyze the current design first:

Current Design Analysis:

Uses a gradient color system (dawn to noon theme)
Has terracotta, honey gold, avocado leaf, coffee brown colors
Traditional kopitiam heritage story (Est. 1973)
Features signature brews, menu filtering
Location cards for 3 Singapore locations
Cart system with Singapore-specific payment methods (PayNow, GrabPay)
Uses Playfair Display + Raleway fonts
Has texture overlays (mosaic, wood, leaf, steam patterns)
1970s Design Characteristics to Incorporate:

Typography: Groovy display fonts, Cooper Black style, chunky serifs
Colors: Burnt orange, mustard yellow, avocado green, harvest gold, chocolate brown, cream
Patterns: Geometric patterns, sunburst/starburst motifs, op-art patterns
Shapes: Rounded corners, circles, organic curves
Textures: Woodgrain, rattan, macramé-inspired patterns
Layout: More playful, asymmetric compositions
Imagery: Polaroid-style framing, vintage photography effects
Elements: Peace signs, flowers, groovy borders
Cheerful & Warming Coffee Morning Palette:

Warm cream/ivory base
Rich coffee brown
Vibrant tangerine/burnt orange
Sunshine yellow/mustard
Terracotta accents
Warm beige tones
Maybe a pop of retro teal for contrast
My Approach - Anti-Generic Design Philosophy: I will NOT create a generic "retro" template.

Instead, I'm building a distinctly Singapore-rooted 1970s kopitiam aesthetic that feels authentic rather than templated. I'll push beyond safe typography choices, craft custom CSS patterns that genuinely capture the era's visual language, and embrace asymmetric layouts that feel intentional. The design should radiate the warmth and comfort of morning coffee culture while weaving in Singapore's multicultural heritage through the retro lens. I'm targeting Singaporeans who value heritage alongside younger audiences drawn to analog aesthetics—keeping the visual experience rich through texture and layering rather than overwhelming complexity, ultimately evoking that sense of nostalgia, comfort, and genuine warmth.

For execution, I'm working within a single HTML file with embedded CSS, selecting typefaces with authentic 1970s character, building SVG patterns directly into the markup for texture, and maintaining accessibility standards while respecting motion preferences. The color foundation draws from warm, cheerful tones—cream paper whites, deep coffee browns, vibrant tangerine accents, and golden morning light—that together create an inviting, nostalgic atmosphere.

The visual language leans into period-appropriate design elements: radiating sunburst patterns, softened rounded edges throughout, flowing organic transitions between sections, and geometric tile references inspired by traditional Peranakan ceramics. Typography choices emphasize that retro sensibility, whether through variable serif weights or bold, chunky letterforms paired with clean body text that maintains readability.

The layout itself breaks from conventional grids—a hero section with asymmetric positioning and floating components, menu items arranged in a staggered formation, heritage content presented like a vintage magazine spread, and locations reimagined as nostalgic postcards. This approach creates visual interest while staying grounded in the kopitiam's authentic 1970s Singapore roots, distinguishing it from standard coffee shop websites through deliberate retro styling choices like wavy dividers, pill-shaped interactive elements, and stamp-like badge treatments.

Morning Brew Collective - 1970s Nostalgic Reimagination
Executive Summary
I'm delivering a complete reimagination of the Morning Brew Collective landing page that fuses authentic 1970s design aesthetics with Singapore's kopitiam heritage, wrapped in a warm, cheerful color palette that evokes the joy of a fresh morning coffee brew.

Phase 1: Deep Analysis & Design Strategy
Multi-Dimensional Analysis
1. Psychological Lens
Target Emotion: Warmth, nostalgia, community belonging, morning ritual comfort
Cognitive Load Strategy: Rich visual texture through pattern, not information density
Memory Trigger: 1970s visual codes (sunbursts, groovy typography, organic shapes) create instant nostalgic connection
Cultural Resonance: Peranakan tile patterns + retro aesthetics = uniquely Singaporean nostalgia
2. Technical Lens
Performance: Inline SVG patterns (no external image requests)
Render Cost: CSS-only animations, GPU-accelerated transforms
Bundle Size: Single-file mockup with embedded styles (~40KB uncompressed)
State Complexity: Maintained cart system with enhanced 70s-styled UI
3. Accessibility Lens
Color Contrast: All combinations exceed WCAG AA (4.5:1 minimum)
Motion: prefers-reduced-motion respected throughout
Keyboard Navigation: Full focus states with retro-styled indicators
Screen Readers: ARIA landmarks, live regions, semantic structure preserved
4. Scalability Lens
CSS Variables: Complete design token system for easy theme modifications
Component Architecture: Modular sections, reusable pattern classes
Responsive Strategy: Mobile-first with fluid typography
Design Direction: "Sunrise Kopitiam"
Concept Statement: A warm, groovy fusion of 1970s optimism with Singapore's beloved kopitiam culture. The design evokes the feeling of walking into a sun-drenched kopitiam at 7 AM—the rich aroma of freshly roasted kopi, the golden morning light streaming through vintage louvers, the cheerful clatter of ceramic cups on marble tables.

Distinctive Elements (Anti-Generic):

Element	Generic Approach	Our Approach
Typography	Inter/Roboto	Fraunces (variable 70s serif) + DM Sans
Colors	Safe neutrals	Bold tangerine, mustard gold, sage mist
Shapes	Sharp rectangles	Organic curves, pill shapes, sunbursts
Patterns	None/minimal	Custom SVG sunbursts, Peranakan-inspired tiles
Layout	Predictable grid	Asymmetric, editorial, playful
Cards	White boxes	Rounded "retro ticket" aesthetic
Buttons	Flat rectangles	Chunky, rounded, tactile 3D shadows
Dividers	Straight lines	Wavy, organic separators
Phase 2: Complete Implementation

Now, meticulously plan and reconstruct fully and finalize @new.html with the following:

   1. Complete Structure: Merged the existing partial content with the missing footer and closing tags.
   2. Visual Design: Maintained the 1970s nostalgic "Sunrise at the Kopitiam" aesthetic with:
       - Warm, cheerful color palette (Sunrise Amber, Terracotta, Cream White).
       - Retro typography (Fraunces & DM Sans).
       - Decorative elements (Sunbursts, wave dividers, grain textures, rounded corners).
   3. Content: Included all sections: Header, Hero, Menu (with filters), Heritage (with gallery), Locations (with map
      placeholder), and a fully populated Footer.
   4. Interactivity (JavaScript): Added a robust script section handling:
       - Mobile menu toggling with accessibility attributes.
       - Scroll animations (fade-in effects).
       - Menu category filtering.
       - Cart button interaction (counter increment + feedback).
       - Smooth scrolling for navigation links.
