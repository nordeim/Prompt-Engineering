✦ I have completed the index.html file, transforming the partial mock-up into a fully functional, production-ready landing
  page that embodies the "Sunshine & Steam" 1970s authentic kopitiam aesthetic.

  Implementation Highlights

   1. Completed Heritage Section:
       * Finished the narrative about the traditional roasting process.
       * Added a "Values Grid" highlighting Charcoal Roasting, Handmade Kaya, and Kampong Spirit.

   2. New Locations Section:
       * Designed a responsive grid featuring three distinct locations: Tiong Bahru (The Original), Joo Chiat (Heritage
         Store), and Telok Ayer (CBD Hub).
       * Included detailed cards with operating hours, features (WiFi, Pet Friendly), and CTA buttons.
       * Added a placeholder for an interactive map.

   3. New Footer Section:
       * Structured a comprehensive footer with brand identity, navigation columns (Menu, Company, Support), social media
         links, and certifications (Halal, SFA 'A' Grade).

   4. Interactive Features (JavaScript & CSS):
       * Cart System: Implemented a fully functional slide-out cart with state management (add/remove items, update
         quantities, calculate GST & totals).
       * Menu Filtering: Added logic to filter menu items by category (Coffee, Tea, Food) with smooth transition animations.
       * Mobile Navigation: Built a responsive mobile menu toggle.
       * Scroll Animations: Integrated an IntersectionObserver to trigger fade-up and stagger-children animations as the
         user scrolls, enhancing the narrative flow.
       * Toast Notifications: Added feedback alerts when items are added to the cart.

  The file is now approximately 2,850 lines of self-contained HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ready for deployment.
