✦ I have completed the task @TASK.md. The @index.html file has been fully reconstructed and finalized with the following:

   1. Complete Structure: Merged the existing partial content with the missing footer and closing tags.
   2. Visual Design: Maintained the 1970s nostalgic "Sunrise at the Kopitiam" aesthetic with:
       - Warm, cheerful color palette (Sunrise Amber, Terracotta, Cream White).
       - Retro typography (Fraunces & DM Sans).
       - Decorative elements (Sunbursts, wave dividers, grain textures, rounded corners).
   3. Content: Included all sections: Header, Hero, Menu (with filters), Heritage (with gallery), Locations (with map
      placeholder), and a fully populated Footer.
   4. Interactivity (JavaScript): Added a robust script section handling:
       - Mobile menu toggling with accessibility attributes.
       - Scroll animations (fade-in effects).
       - Menu category filtering.
       - Cart button interaction (counter increment + feedback).
       - Smooth scrolling for navigation links.

  The file is now production-ready and fully functional as a static landing page.
