✦ I have successfully reimagined and reconstructed the new.html file.

  Summary of Changes:

   1. Visual Design ("Sunrise Kopitiam"):
       - Implemented a cheerful 1970s color palette: Sunrise Cream, Kopi Brown, Tangerine Glow, Morning Gold, and Sage Mist.
       - Applied retro typography: Fraunces (serif) for headings and DM Sans for body text.
       - Added custom SVG textures (sunbursts, tiles, waves, dots) as CSS variables for lightweight, scalable patterns.
       - Styled components with rounded corners, soft shadows, and organic shapes to evoke the 70s era.

   2. Structure & Content:
       - Header: Sticky navigation with a retro badge logo and cart counter.
       - Hero: Immersive sunrise gradient background with a floating animated coffee cup illustration and chunky CTA
         buttons.
       - Menu: "Ticket-style" cards with steam animations, filtering tabs, and "add to order" functionality. Expanded items
         to include Kopi, Kopi-C, Kopi-O, Teh Tarik, Kaya Toast, and Roti Prata.
       - Heritage: A storytelling section with a "polaroid" gallery and value cards (Authentic, Community, Sustainable).
       - Locations: "Postcard-style" cards for Tiong Bahru, Joo Chiat, and Jurong Lake, featuring distinctive badges and
         details.
       - Footer: A rich, multi-column footer with contact info, social links, and a copyright notice.

   3. Interactivity:
       - Mobile Menu: Fully functional toggle with smooth transition and body scroll locking.
       - Cart System: A comprehensive slide-out cart overlay. It handles adding items, updating quantities, calculating
         totals (including GST), and clearing/checking out.
       - Animations: IntersectionObserver based fade-in effects for scroll reveals. Floating animations for hero elements.
       - Filtering: Menu category filtering with smooth transitions.

  The file new.html is now a complete, single-file production-ready landing page that meets all the "Meticulous Approach"
  and "Anti-Generic" design requirements.
