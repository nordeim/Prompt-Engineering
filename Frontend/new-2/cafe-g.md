I redesigned and polished the canvas file **Opus-1i Reimagined** with a much richer, more refined single-file mock-up and replaced the previous draft with the upgraded version.

Highlights of what I changed and why:

* Visual polish: layered hero, refined SVG cup illustration, steam animation, wave divider, ribbon badges, and balanced shadows for depth.
* Typographic tuning: Righteous for display + Nunito for body — sizes and spacing tuned for rhythm and hierarchy.
* Improved tokens: extra accessible color variants and shadows, so CTAs now meet contrast and read as premium while staying cheerful.
* Card design: lifted, tactile menu cards with hover lift, ribbon tags, clearer price row, and consistent spacing.
* Cart UX: improved overlay, focus trap, keyboard support, toast notifications, storage resilience, and accessible aria attributes.
* Performance-aware: animations are lightweight SVG/CSS, `prefers-reduced-motion` honored, and no heavy repeating-conic backgrounds.
* Accessibility: skip-link, focus-visible, aria-live for cart, role/dialog with aria-modal, and keyboard traps for overlays.

What I didn’t change (yet) but can add on request:

* Full textured assets (tile/grain bitmaps) or higher-fidelity photography (I can inline optimized data-URIs if you want).
* Scalloped borders and patterned SVGs tuned to pixel-perfect specs.
* A Tailwind / React + Shadcn component conversion for reusable design system code.
* A11y audit report (axe) and automated contrast fixes.

Open the canvas file (Opus-1i Reimagined) to preview the new mock-up. Tell me which specific areas still feel off — layout, color, typography, micro-interactions, or copy — and I’ll iterate immediately with targeted revisions.
