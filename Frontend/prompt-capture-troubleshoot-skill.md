Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically how best to capture your knowledge and experience in troubleshooting the issue of navigation bar "disappeared" (not visible) when the HTML page is viewed in mobile browser/mode. My coding agent is consistently causing the issue when asked to design an HTML mock-up for a website, so I want you to help me think of how to create a comprehensive programming and troubleshooting guide that will be used as a "skills" handbook to design a HTML without this issue or bug, and also to teach/guide the coding agent how to troubleshoot and fix similar issue/bug in an existing HTML file. Then meticulously plan to create such a programming, design and troubleshooting guide/handbook. Review and validate the implementation plan before proceeding to execute it.
