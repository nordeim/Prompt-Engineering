Please think deeper and think harder to deeply and thoroughly explore systematically and meticulously reimagine a landing page for a Singapore-based cafe shop with the following requirements:

1. Invoke nostalgia of the 1970s (using styles from the provided HTML sample **attached** as design inspiration)
2. Use a more refreshing and cheerful color scheme - cheerful and warming like aromatic fresh coffee in the morning

Analyze the below design and think about how to transform it into a 1970s nostalgic aesthetic with a cheerful, warm color palette.

The existing design has:

- A modern kopitiam theme with earth tones (terracotta, honey gold, avocado, coffee brown)
- Clean, contemporary typography (Playfair Display + Raleway)
- Gradient backgrounds for sections
- Texture overlays (mosaic, wood, leaf, steam patterns)
- Modern card-based menu layout
- Sticky navigation
- Cart system

## 1970s Design Research & Inspiration
The 1970s aesthetic was characterized by:

**Color Palette:**
- Burnt orange, mustard yellow, avocado green, harvest gold
- Earth tones: brown, rust, terracotta
- Warm beiges and creams
- Occasional pops of teal/turquoise
- BUT the user wants "refreshing and cheerful" - so I need to brighten this up while keeping the retro feel

**Typography:**
- Geometric sans-serifs (like ITC Avant Garde, Futura)
- Bold, chunky display fonts
- Rounded letterforms
- Cooper Black was iconic
- Psychedelic/groovy curved lettering
- Hand-drawn, friendly fonts

** Layout & Graphics:**
- Rounded corners everywhere
- Sunburst/starburst patterns
- Geometric patterns (circles, arcs, waves)
- Organic, flowing shapes
- Mushroom/flower motifs
- Gradients (especially sunset-like)
- Bold stripes
- Retro illustration style
- Thick borders and decorative frames
- Woodgrain textures and macramé-inspired patterns
- Scalloped edges

## Cheerful & Refreshing 1970s Color Palette
Since the user wants "cheerful and warming like aromatic fresh coffee", I'll use Rich Coffee Brown (#6B4423) as the base, paired with Sunrise Orange (#FF7F50) for warmth and cheer, Morning Gold (#FFD93D) for brightness and optimism, and Cream Latte (#FFF8E7) for warm backgrounds. A touch of Mint Green will add that refreshing element while maintaining the retro vibe.

## Design Direction: "Retro Morning Sunshine"
The landing page should evoke walking into a sunny 1970s coffee shop with warm morning light, creating a friendly and inviting atmosphere that feels handcrafted and artisanal—nostalgic without feeling dated.

## Key Design Decisions
For typography, I'll use a groovy retro font like Cooper Black for display text to capture that 1970s feel, paired with a friendly rounded sans-serif for body copy. Google Fonts options like "Righteous" work well for the display layer, with "Nunito" or similar for readable body text.

The color palette centers on warm, sunrise-inspired tones: cream backgrounds (#FFF8E7), a vibrant sunrise coral (#FF6B4A) as the primary color, golden hour yellows (#FFB84D) for secondary accents, deep coffee bean brown (#5D3A1A) for contrast, and soft mint (#E8F5E9) to add freshness. Espresso text (#3D2317) grounds everything.

Visual elements should include sunburst patterns, generous rounded corners, wavy section dividers, retro badges, coffee cup illustrations with steam wisps, and geometric shapes like circles and arcs. Hand-drawn decorative touches reinforce the artisanal quality.

The layout approach emphasizes playfulness over rigid structure—asymmetrical arrangements, abundant whitespace, overlapping layers for depth, and curved dividers create visual interest. Micro-interactions like subtle hover effects, bouncy transitions, and animated coffee steam add personality.

Implementation starts with restructuring the header with retro logo treatment, building a sunburst hero section, styling menu cards with rounded corners, adding vintage photo frames to the heritage section, creating retro map styling for locations, and designing a patterned footer. Next comes visual polish through SVG sunburst patterns, wavy dividers, retro badge designs, and decorative borders. Finally, animations including restyled coffee steam effects and interactive hover states bring everything to life.

The design should authentically capture 1970s kopitiam culture—blending Singapore's multicultural influences from that era with Western retro aesthetics. This means incorporating tile patterns from traditional shophouses, bamboo and rattan textures, and tropical elements rather than simply applying a surface-level retro filter. Distinctive features like sunburst backgrounds, scalloped section edges, and period-appropriate typography create something genuinely memorable and rooted in the specific time and place.

🌅 Morning Brew Collective — 1970s Retro Reimagination

## Executive Summary
You will deliver a complete re-imagination of the Morning Brew Collective landing page, invoking authentic 1970s Singapore kopitiam nostalgia with a refreshing, cheerful color palette reminiscent of the first aromatic coffee brew at sunrise.

## Phase 1: Deep Design Analysis & Conceptual Direction

### 1.1 Multi-Dimensional Requirement Mining
Lens	, Analysis
**Psychological**:	1970s nostalgia triggers warmth, familiarity, and trust. Cheerful colors reduce cognitive load and increase dwell time. The "morning ritual" concept creates emotional anchoring.  
**Technical**:	SVG patterns over images for performance. CSS custom properties for consistent theming. Minimal JS dependencies for fast LCP.  
**Accessibility**:	High contrast ratios (WCAG AAA target: 7:1). Focus indicators styled in-theme. Reduced motion support.  
**Scalability**:	CSS layer architecture. Modular component structure. Easy color palette swaps via CSS variables.

### 1.2 Conceptual Direction: "Sunrise at the Kopitiam"
The "Why" Factor: Visitors will remember the warmth that radiates from every element—not generic retro kitsch, but an authentic re-creation of the optimistic 1970s Singapore morning where hawkers opened their stalls at dawn, ceramic cups clinked, and the aroma of freshly roasted kopi filled the humid air.

**Aesthetic Pillars:**

1. Sunburst Motifs — The rising sun as a recurring visual metaphor
2. Rounded Geometry — Soft, approachable forms that reject sharp modernity
3. Bold Color Blocking — Confident sections with distinct personalities
4. Handcrafted Textures — Subtle grain, coffee stains, tile patterns
5. Groovy Typography — Playful yet legible retro letterforms
