Awesome meticulous job so far! Please keep up the good work! But I don't like all dark look, use a lighter, more refreshing and cheerful color scheme and contrast, as cheerful and warming like an aromatic fresh coffee brew in the morning.

Awesome meticulous job so far! Please keep up the good work! One defect is that your static HTML mock-up is not auto responsive - it seems to be always show in a vertical column even when viewed on a desktop. Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply and thoroughly explore systematically and meticulously re-imagine the landing page for a Singapore based small-to-medium cafe shop business that gives the following impressions:

1) invokes nostalgia of the 1970s (use some styles from the `static-html.txt` file shared earlier) . 
2) use a more refreshing and cheerful color scheme and contrast, as cheerful and warming like an aromatic fresh coffee brew in the morning.

Then meticulously plan and create your best re-imagined landing page mock-up HTML for the cafe shop e-commerce website.
