Awesome meticulous job so far! Please keep up the good work! But I don't like all dark look, use a lighter, more refreshing and cheerful color scheme and contrast, as cheerful and warming like an aromatic fresh coffee brew in the morning.

Awesome meticulous job so far! Please keep up the good work! One defect is that your static HTML mock-up is not auto responsive - it seems to be always show in a vertical column even when viewed on a desktop. Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply and thoroughly explore systematically and meticulously re-imagine the landing page for a Singapore based small-to-medium cafe shop business that gives the following impressions:

1) invokes nostalgia of the 1970s (use some styles from the `static-html.txt` file shared earlier) . 
2) use a more refreshing and cheerful color scheme and contrast, as cheerful and warming like an aromatic fresh coffee brew in the morning.

Then meticulously plan and create your best re-imagined landing page mock-up HTML for the cafe shop e-commerce website.

Now, please meticulously review and analyze the attached static HTML mock-up for a small to medium-sized Singapore business operating cafe outlets. Then think deeper and think harder to deeply and thoroughly explore systematically and meticulously how best to re-imagine it to be more visually attractive and striking, with horizontal navigation bar when displayed on a desktop browser, but the navigation bar is collapsed into a menu on the top right when in mobile display mode. Currently the page is all uniform light brown throughout, though the background is nice, but we need graduation for different sections, also the page will need some animations and hover effects, better color gradients and framing of items, more detailed footer bar, more naturally flow of sections when scrolled from top to bottom. Then meticulously plan to create a refined re-imagined e-commerce website for a cafe business. Review and validate the implementation plan before executing it.

The site should invoke nostalgia of the 1970s (use some styles from the static-html.txt file shared earlier) . Use a more refreshing and cheerful color scheme and contrast, as cheerful and warming like an aromatic fresh coffee brew in the morning.
