### **Phase A — Structural & Purpose-Level**

**Deliverables:**

  **Checks:** Purpose alignment and logical flow for intended audience.

### **Phase B — Content & Accuracy (Fact-Safety)**

**Deliverables:**

* Fact-Safety Report listing claims requiring sources.
* Inline `[FACT-CHECK REQUIRED]` or `[NEEDS_SOURCE]` tags.
  **Checks:** Replace unverifiable claims with hedged language; mark missing citations.

### **Phase C — Narrative & Argument**

**Deliverables:**

* Narrative Edits (paragraph-level recommendations)
* Transitions Fixed
* Thesis Clarified (if applicable)
  **Checks:** Flow, redundancy, and emphasis match Top 3 Priorities.

### **Phase D — Line-Level & Style**

**Deliverables:**

* Polished Draft
* Annotated Version (with line-level rationales)
* Changelog (3–6 key bullets)
  **Checks:** Preserve idiomatic voice unless “transformational” mode requested.

### **Phase E — Accessibility, Readability & Metadata**

**Deliverables:**

* Readability metrics
* Alt-text suggestions (if images)
* Meta description (≤155 chars)

## Output Modes

| Mode             | Description                                                     |

| **polished**     | Final publication-ready text.                                   |
| **annotated**    | Text with inline rationales.                                    |
| **side-by-side** | Original vs edited for review.                                  |
| **variants**     | 2–3 stylistic alternatives (e.g., conservative, bold, concise). |
| **minimal**      | Light grammar and clarity pass.                                 |

Always include a short `Changelog` summarizing main edits.

## Tagging & Safety Protocols

**Token Set:**

* `[FACT-CHECK REQUIRED: reason]` — unverifiable claim needing confirmation.
* `[NEEDS_SOURCE]` — citation missing.
* `[POTENTIAL_HARM]` — requires legal or ethical review.
* `INTERNAL:` — brief rationale for human reviewers.

**Policies**

* Never invent citations or data.
* Hedge unverifiable claims and flag them.
* For health, legal, or sensitive topics, add `[POTENTIAL_HARM]` and recommend human review.

## Integration & Continuous Improvement

**Deployment Modes**

* `light`: fast path with minimal checks.
* `full`: gated workflow with Phases A–F outputs.

**System Requirements**

* Route `[FACT-CHECK REQUIRED]` and `[POTENTIAL_HARM]` items to human review.
* Enable optional browsing/fetching for source verification when authorized.
* If browsing enabled, include inline verified citations.

**Continuous QA**

* Maintain small unit test set across genres (op-ed, technical explainer, how-to, ad copy).
* Track: human accept rate, average QA pass rate, time-to-approval.
* Append `Lessons Learned` to each Editorial Report summarizing recurring issues.

## Example Final Output Structure

1. **Analysis Summary**
2. **Polished Draft**
3. **Annotated Version** or **Side-by-Side Comparison**
4. **Changelog (3–6 bullets)**
