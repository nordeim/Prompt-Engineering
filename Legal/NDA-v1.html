        <div class="clause">
          <ol>
            <li>The Parties acknowledge that unauthorised disclosure may cause irreparable harm. In addition to any other remedy (including injunctive relief and specific performance), the Parties agree the following mutual liquidated amount applies:</li>
            <li><strong>Agreed Sum:</strong> If a Party (the “Breaching Party”) discloses any Confidential Information to any third party in breach of this Agreement (whether intentional or unintentional), the Breaching Party shall pay the Disclosing Party a sum of <strong>One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$100,000)</strong> (the “Agreed Sum”) as liquidated damages for that disclosure. The Parties agree the Agreed Sum represents a genuine pre-estimate of loss and is not intended as a penalty.</li>
            <li><strong>Intention &amp; Construction:</strong> Each Party expressly acknowledges that the Agreed Sum is intended as a genuine pre-estimate of damage (not a penalty), and has been agreed because actual damages for unauthorized disclosure are difficult to quantify.</li>
            <li><strong>Severability / Alternative Relief:</strong> If a court determines the Agreed Sum (or part of Clause 7) is a penalty and unenforceable, that determination will not affect the remainder of this Agreement. The Disclosing Party may still seek injunctive or other equitable relief and actual damages, and the Parties will negotiate in good faith a lawful alternative liquidated amount proportionate to the injury caused by disclosure.</li>

          <p><strong>Practical note:</strong> The Parties have expressly agreed the Agreed Sum (US$100,000) is a genuine pre-estimate of loss. Under Singapore law, courts examine whether a liquidated sum is a genuine pre-estimate or a penalty. To reduce enforceability risk, maintain documentary evidence supporting the commercial basis for the amount (internal commercial rationale or negotiation record). This draft preserves injunctive and actual damage remedies if a court were to invalidate the Agreed Sum. Please obtain local legal advice before execution.</p>
