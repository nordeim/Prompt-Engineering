Thanks — I’ll draft a carefully considered, Singapore-governed **mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)** for **ABC Pte Ltd** and **DEF Pte Ltd**, and I’ll first give a short, focused plan (the “Meticulous Approach” plan), note the relevant Singapore law context that informed drafting choices (with citations), then deliver the full draft NDA ready for review and execution. I’m not a substitute for a licensed Singapore lawyer — please have this final draft reviewed by your Singapore counsel before signing.

## Plan (concise)

1. Confirm parties, mutual nature, and 3-year confidentiality term (per your requirements).
2. Define “Confidential Information” broadly but include standard exclusions.
3. Draft mutual obligations (use, disclosure limitation, employees/contractors, permitted disclosures).
4. Add return/destruction, notice requirements, and survival provisions.
5. Insert the mutual **$100,000** liquidated-damages / penalty provision as requested, but (a) expressly state parties’ intention that the sum is a genuine pre-estimate of loss and (b) include severability and alternative remedies (injunctive relief/disgorgement) to preserve enforceability under Singapore law.
6. Choose governing law (Singapore) and exclusive jurisdiction (Singapore courts).
7. Add standard miscellaneous clauses (assignment, entire agreement, counterparts, execution).
8. Recommend review by Singapore counsel and include a short note on the enforceability risk of large fixed sum clauses under Singapore law and the drafting choices made to reduce risk.

## Legal context that informed drafting choices (key points & sources)

* Singapore courts apply the traditional **Dunlop** / pre-estimate test in assessing whether a clause is a penalty (and thus unenforceable). The Singapore Court of Appeal has reaffirmed that approach (so a pure punitive “penalty” is at risk of being struck down). ([Clifford Chance][1])
* Liquidated damages provisions are enforceable in Singapore **if** they are a genuine pre-estimate of probable loss (not a penalty). Drafting should therefore include an express statement of intention that the agreed sum is a genuine pre-estimate of loss. ([whitecase.com][2])
* Model NDAs and local practice emphasize injunctive relief (equitable remedies) as often important in confidentiality contexts — clauses should therefore preserve rights to seek injunctions in addition to monetary remedies. ([Singapore Academy of Law][3])

# MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

**This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement** (the “Agreement”) is made as of **[_______]** (the “Effective Date”)

**Between**

(1) **ABC Pte Ltd**, a company incorporated in Singapore (UEN: __________) whose registered office is at ________________________ (“ABC”); and
(2) **DEF Pte Ltd**, a company incorporated in Singapore (UEN: __________) whose registered office is at ________________________ (“DEF”).

(Each a “Party” and together the “Parties”.)

**Recitals**

A. The Parties wish to explore a potential business relationship and, in connection with that purpose, each Party may disclose to the other certain confidential and proprietary information.
B. The Parties wish to set out their respective obligations with respect to such confidential information.

**Agreement**

1. **Definitions**
   1.1 “Confidential Information” means all information (whether oral, written, electronic, visual or in any other form) disclosed by a Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party, whether before or after the Effective Date, including but not limited to business plans, drawings, designs, specifications, prototypes, technical data, software (including source code), know-how, marketing plans, financial information, customer and supplier lists, pricing and any other information which by its nature ought reasonably to be treated as confidential.
   1.2 “Disclosing Party” means the Party disclosing Confidential Information on a particular occasion.
   1.3 “Receiving Party” means the Party receiving Confidential Information on a particular occasion.

2. **Obligations of Confidentiality**
   2.1 The Receiving Party shall:
   (a) keep Confidential Information strictly confidential and use at least the same degree of care to protect it as it uses to protect its own confidential information (but no less than a reasonable standard of care);
   (b) only use Confidential Information for the Purpose (defined below); and
   (c) not disclose Confidential Information to any third party except as permitted by Clause 3 or with the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.

   2.2 “Purpose” means evaluation and discussion of a possible business relationship or transaction between the Parties and any negotiations or agreements arising out of such discussions.

3. **Permitted Disclosures**
   3.1 The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, officers, professional advisers, contractors or agents (“Representatives”) who have a legitimate need to know the information for the Purpose, provided that:
   (a) the Receiving Party remains responsible for any breach of this Agreement by such Representatives; and
   (b) the Receiving Party procures that such Representatives are bound by confidentiality obligations no less onerous than those in this Agreement.

   3.2 The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable law, regulation or order of a court or governmental authority (a “Legal Compulsion”), provided that, to the extent legally permitted, the Receiving Party (i) gives the Disclosing Party prompt written notice of the Legal Compulsion and (ii) cooperates with the Disclosing Party (at the Disclosing Party’s cost) in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy to limit disclosure.

4. **Exclusions**
   The obligations in Clause 2 shall not apply to any information which the Receiving Party can demonstrate by written records:
   (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or its Representatives;
   (b) was rightfully in the Receiving Party’s possession prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party and without obligation of confidentiality;
   (c) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party who has the right to disclose it and who is not under an obligation of confidentiality; or
   (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

5. **Term and Survival**
   5.1 The obligations in Clause 2 shall commence on the Effective Date and, except as provided in Clause 5.2, shall continue for a period of **three (3) years** from the date of signing this Agreement.
   5.2 Clauses that by their nature are intended to survive expiration or termination (including Clause 4 (Exclusions), Clause 6 (Return or Destruction), Clause 8 (Remedies), Clause 9 (Limitation of Liability), Clause 10 (Governing Law & Jurisdiction), and Clause 11 (Miscellaneous)) shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.

6. **Return or Destruction**
   On written request by the Disclosing Party (and in any event on termination of discussions or at expiry of this Agreement), the Receiving Party shall, at the Disclosing Party’s option, promptly return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all documents and materials (and any copies) containing Confidential Information, except that the Receiving Party may retain one archival copy for legal or compliance purposes subject to the confidentiality obligations in this Agreement.

7. **Mutual Remedies; Liquidated Amount**
   7.1 The Parties acknowledge and agree that a breach of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages may be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, the Parties agree that, in addition to any other remedy available at law or in equity (including injunctive relief and specific performance), the following mutual liquidated amount shall apply:
   (a) If a Party (the “Breaching Party”) discloses any Confidential Information to any third party in breach of this Agreement (whether such disclosure is intentional or unintentional), the Breaching Party shall pay to the Disclosing Party a sum of **One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$100,000)** (the “Agreed Sum”) as liquidated damages for that disclosure. The Parties agree that the Agreed Sum represents a genuine pre-estimate of the loss likely to be suffered by the Disclosing Party as a result of such disclosure and is not a penalty.

   7.2 **Intention & Construction:** Each Party expressly acknowledges and agrees that:
   (a) the Agreed Sum is intended to operate as a genuine pre-estimate of damage and not as a penalty;
   (b) the Parties have considered the difficulty of accurately calculating damages for unauthorized disclosure and have agreed that the Agreed Sum is a sensible and proportionate pre-estimate; and
   (c) the Agreed Sum shall apply reciprocally and without regard to whether the disclosure was intentional or unintentional.

   7.3 **Severability / Alternative Relief:** If any competent court or tribunal determines that any part of Clause 7 (including the Agreed Sum) is a penalty and thus unenforceable, such determination shall not affect the remainder of this Agreement. In such event:
   (a) the Disclosing Party shall remain entitled to seek injunctive or equitable relief (including specific performance) and to claim actual damages and any other remedies available at law or in equity; and
   (b) the Parties agree that the Parties will in good faith negotiate an alternative liquidated amount that is consistent with applicable law and proportionate to the injury caused by disclosure.

8. **No Licence; No Warranty**
   8.1 Nothing in this Agreement grants the Receiving Party any rights (by licence or otherwise) in or to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information except as expressly set out.
   8.2 All Confidential Information is provided “as is.” The Disclosing Party makes no warranties, express or implied, regarding the accuracy or completeness of its Confidential Information.

9. **Limitation of Liability**
   Except for liability arising from wilful misconduct, fraud or breach of Clause 2 (Confidentiality), and except for the Agreed Sum under Clause 7, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential loss arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

10. **Governing Law and Jurisdiction**
    10.1 This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Singapore.
    10.2 The Parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Singapore in respect of any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

11. **Miscellaneous**
    11.1 **Assignment.** Neither Party may assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, except in the case of assignment to an affiliate or by operation of law in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of a Party’s business or assets.
    11.2 **Entire Agreement.** This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties regarding Confidential Information and supersedes all prior agreements relating to the same subject matter.
    11.3 **Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
    11.4 **Waiver.** No waiver of any right under this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the Party granting the waiver. No waiver of any breach shall constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.
    11.5 **Counterparts and Electronic Execution.** This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and by electronic means (including scanned signature pages); counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

## Short drafting notes and practical guidance

1. **$100,000 Agreed Sum & Singapore law risk:** Singapore courts apply the Dunlop pre-estimate test when determining whether a clause is a penalty. To reduce the risk of a court treating the Agreed Sum as a penalty and refusing enforcement, the Agreement (a) expressly states the Parties’ intention that the Agreed Sum is a genuine pre-estimate, (b) allows other remedies (injunctive relief, actual damages) and (c) provides for good-faith negotiation of an alternative liquidated amount if a court strikes the clause down. (See sources cited above.) ([Clifford Chance][1])

2. **Equitable relief:** In confidentiality contexts, injunctive relief is commonly sought and frequently appropriate; the Agreement preserves that remedy in Clause 7.3 and elsewhere. ([Singapore Academy of Law][3])

3. **Tailoring & review:** If the $100,000 amount is intended to operate as a deterrent rather than a genuine pre-estimate, this creates a real enforceability risk in Singapore. If you want stronger enforceability: (a) provide a clear reasoned basis (commercial rationale) in the contract file or negotiating record documenting why $100,000 is a reasonable pre-estimate; or (b) tie the sum to a calculable basis (per-record or per-document, or percentage of contract value) or tiered schedule of liquidated damages — all of which can help satisfy the court’s pre-estimate inquiry. Consult Singapore counsel for preferred drafting and any business-specific tailoring.

If you’d like, I can now:

* produce a clean PDF/Word version of this Agreement ready for signatures, or
* tailor the liquidated damages mechanism (e.g., tiered sums, per-breach schedule, or a sliding scale tied to the quantum of disclosed records) to better align with enforceability under Singapore law and your commercial objectives, or
* insert additional clauses (IP protections, non-solicit, return of copies held by third parties, detailed notice addresses, or a specific arbitration seat instead of courts).

Which of those (if any) would you like me to prepare next?
