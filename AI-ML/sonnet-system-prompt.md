# Phase 1: Deep Analysis & Research ‚Äî GPT-5 Prompting for AI/ML Research Agent

## Executive Summary

I will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the GPT-5 prompting guide, extract the most impactful best practices, and synthesize them into an optimal system prompt for an AI/ML Research Agent. This involves analyzing key GPT-5 capabilities, understanding domain-specific requirements, and crafting a production-ready prompt that maximizes the model's strengths.

## Detailed Analysis & Key Findings

### üîç Critical GPT-5 Prompting Insights

After thorough analysis of the guide, I've identified these essential principles for optimal prompting:

#### 1. **Instruction Clarity & Consistency** (Most Critical)
- **Finding**: GPT-5's "surgical precision" in following instructions means contradictions severely impair performance
- **Implication**: Must eliminate any conflicting directives about when to act, how thorough to be, or what to prioritize
- **Application**: AI/ML research prompt must have clear hierarchy of priorities without contradictions

#### 2. **Agentic Autonomy Calibration**
- **Finding**: GPT-5 operates on spectrum from highly autonomous to tightly controlled
- **Best Practice**: For research tasks, encourage persistence with clear escalation paths
- **Key Prompt Pattern**: 
  ```
  <persistence>
  - Keep going until query is resolved
  - Never stop at uncertainty‚Äîresearch and deduce
  - Document assumptions rather than asking for confirmation
  </persistence>
  ```

#### 3. **Reasoning Effort & Verbosity Control**
- **Finding**: `reasoning_effort` (low/medium/high) + `verbosity` (low/medium/high) are independent
- **For Research Agent**: High reasoning effort + medium-high verbosity for comprehensive yet clear explanations
- **Natural Language Override**: Can specify different verbosity for different contexts (e.g., "be concise in summaries but comprehensive in methodology explanations")

#### 4. **Structured Planning & Self-Reflection**
- **Finding**: Prompting for explicit planning and self-reflection dramatically improves complex task performance
- **Application**: Research agent should plan research approach, reflect on findings, iterate on understanding
- **Example Pattern**:
  ```
  <research_workflow>
  1. Decompose the research question
  2. Plan investigation strategy
  3. Execute research systematically
  4. Synthesize and validate findings
  5. Reflect on gaps and iterate
  </research_workflow>
  ```

#### 5. **Tool Preambles for Transparency**
- **Finding**: GPT-5 excels at providing clear upfront plans and progress updates
- **For Research**: Essential for explaining research methodology and progress
- **Pattern**: "Always begin by outlining your research approach before executing it"

#### 6. **Domain-Specific Workflow Definition**
- **Finding**: Explicit workflow steps improve consistency (see TauBench and Terminal-Bench examples)
- **Application**: Define specific workflows for: literature review, concept explanation, implementation, experimentation, paper analysis, etc.

#### 7. **XML Structuring Best Practice**
- **Finding**: Cursor and OpenAI examples consistently use XML-like tags `<section_name>`
- **Benefit**: Clear semantic boundaries, easy reference, improved instruction adherence
- **Application**: Structure prompt with clear sections: identity, principles, workflows, quality standards
