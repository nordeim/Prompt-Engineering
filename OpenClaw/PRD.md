- SQLite for all persistent local data (WAL mode, foreign keys)
- Vector embeddings standardized on Google `gemini-embedding-001` (768-dim) across all stores (KB, CRM, business-meta-analysis, OpenClaw memory index)
- Telegram as the primary notification and interaction channel
- All cron jobs logged to a central database with Telegram notifications
- Shared modules (`shared/`) for common functionality across tools and skills
- `gog` CLI for all Google Workspace access (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, etc.)

## CRM System

**Location:** `crm/` (tracked directly in this repo)
**Database:** `~/clawd/crm/data/contacts.db`
**Skill interface:** `skills/crm-query/`
**Stats:** ~1,174 contacts tracked

### What It Does

A personal CRM that automatically discovers contacts from email and calendar, tracks relationships with vector-based semantic search, integrates with Box for document relevance, supports AI-assisted email drafting, and provides a natural language query interface via Telegram.
Operational CRM workflows (querying, follow-ups, meeting processing, and drafting handoffs) are documented in `docs/USE-CASES-WORKFLOWS.md`.

### Contact Discovery

- Scans Gmail and Google Calendar (last 365 days) via the `gog` CLI
- Filters out newsletters, automated senders, large meetings (>10 people), internal domains (forwardfuture.ai)
- Learning system (`pattern-learner.js`): builds skip patterns from approve/reject decisions, suggests auto-add mode after 50 decisions
- Anti-injection security: sanitizes email content, blocks prompt injection patterns

Uses parallel independent expert architecture: 8 domain-filtered experts (GrowthStrategist, RevenueGuardian, SkepticalOperator, TeamDynamicsArchitect, AutomationScout, CFO, ContentStrategist, MarketAnalyst) analyze their relevant data slices in parallel, then a synthesizer merges their findings into ranked recommendations. Each expert only sees signals from their tagged sources plus a cross-domain brief. Calls model provider APIs directly (auto-detects from openclaw.json: prefers Anthropic, falls back to OpenAI/Google).

| `log-hub.js` | Unified log viewer. Reads `~/clawd/data/logs/all.jsonl` and supports filters (`--event`, `--level`, `--contains`, `--since`, `--limit`, `--json`) for single-pane troubleshooting. |
| `log-ingest.js` | Nightly JSONL -> SQLite ingestor for structured logs. Reads unified stream (`all.jsonl` + rotated `all.jsonl.N`) and writes deduped rows to `~/clawd/data/logs.db`. |
| `gateway-log-ingest.js` | Nightly raw-log -> SQLite ingestor for OpenClaw gateway logs. Reads `~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.log` and `gateway.err.log` (+ rotations) into `~/clawd/data/logs.db` table `gateway_log_lines`. |
| `redact-message.js` | CLI tool for redacting secrets from outbound notification messages. Reads from stdin or args, uses `notification-redaction.js`. Usage: `echo "..." \| node tools/redact-message.js` or `node tools/redact-message.js "message text"` |
| `log-event.js` | CLI tool for logging structured JSONL events to `~/clawd/data/logs/<event_name>.jsonl`, mirrored into unified stream `~/clawd/data/logs/all.jsonl`. Accepts `--event`, `--level`, and `--field key=value` args. Auto-parses field values (JSON, numbers, booleans, strings). |
| `openclaw-slack-status.js` | Diagnostic tool for OpenClaw Slack connection status. Finds gateway PID, lists established TCP connections, probes TLS certificates to identify services (Slack, Telegram, etc.), tails gateway.log for recent `[slack]` lines. Outputs JSON or human-readable format. |

## Cron Jobs

All cron jobs follow a standardized pattern (defined in AGENTS.md):

1. Log start: `cd ~/clawd/tools/cron-log && node log-start.js --job "<name>"` → capture run ID
2. Execute task
3. Log end: `cd ~/clawd/tools/cron-log && node log-end.js --run-id <ID> --status <success|failure> --summary "..."`
4. Send Telegram notification to group `-1003725393532` topic `1126` (cron-updates)

For workflow-level behavior (triggers, flow steps, and failure handling), see `docs/USE-CASES-WORKFLOWS.md`.

### Launchd Services

| Plist | Schedule | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `ai.openclaw.gateway` | Always-on (RunAtLoad + KeepAlive) | OpenClaw gateway server on port 18789 |

---

## Memory System

**Location:** `memory/`

### Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Daily notes - raw capture of conversations, events, tasks. Written first, always. |
| `MEMORY.md` (root) | Synthesized wisdom - distilled patterns, preferences, lessons. Only loaded in direct chats with Matt. |
| `memory/heartbeat-state.json` | Heartbeat check timestamps (email, calendar, weather, errorLog, securityAudit) |
| `memory/tasks/` | Task history - append-only, structured format per `SCHEMA.md` |
| `memory/tasks/SCHEMA.md` | Task history schema definition |
| `memory/health/` | Health tracking - food logs (`food-log.json`, `food-log.md`), README |

### State & Reference Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ai-tweet-feedback.json` | AI tweet feedback patterns (what performs well) |
| `ai-tweets-search-strategy.json` | Search strategy for AI tweet curation |
| `ai-tweets-shared.json` | History of shared AI tweets (dedup) |
| `video-pitches.json` | Video pitch catalog (backup; primary is SQLite DB) |

| `security-audit-full-2026-02-10.md` | Full security audit report |
| `security-review-log.md` | Security review log history |

### How It Works

- **Write first:** Daily notes (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) capture everything in the moment
- **Synthesize weekly:** Cron job (Sunday 3:40am PST) distills daily notes into `MEMORY.md`
- **Heartbeat tracking:** Checks stored in `heartbeat-state.json` with timestamps for each check type
- **Task history:** Append-only format, one section per task, never edited after writing

## Databases

All databases are SQLite with WAL mode enabled.

Operational logging model is hybrid: structured event logs are canonical in JSONL (`~/clawd/data/logs/all.jsonl` plus per-event files), while SQLite is used for query-heavy datasets (`cron-log.db`, `interactions.db`, and domain databases).

| Database | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| CRM | `~/clawd/crm/data/contacts.db` | Contacts, interactions, follow-ups, context (with vectors), meetings, action items, relationship profiles, Box files/chunks/collaborators/links, email draft requests, merge suggestions, meta state |
| Video Pitches | `~/clawd/data/video-pitches.db` | Video pitch ideas with embeddings for semantic search |
| Business Meta-Analysis | `~/clawd/data/business-meta-analysis.db` | Source catalog, signal runs, analysis artifacts, recommendations, feedback, deeper-dive requests, weight policies |
| YouTube Analytics | `tools/social-tracker/db/views.db` | YouTube video analytics (views, watch time, avg view duration/percentage, likes, dislikes, comments, shares, subs gained/lost, thumbnail impressions/CTR) + video metadata (description, tags, category) - ~963 videos tracked |
| YouTube Data | `tools/social-tracker/db/youtube_data.db` | YouTube video metadata |
| Social Growth | `tools/social-tracker/db/social_growth.db` | Instagram/TikTok follower metrics + Instagram per-post analytics (ig_media, ig_media_stats with follows/reel view time) + Instagram account daily snapshots (ig_account_stats) + X/Twitter per-post analytics (x_posts with public_metrics view counts, x_post_stats hourly snapshots with 21 metrics) |
| Cron Log | `~/clawd/data/cron-log.db` | Cron job run history (start/end times, status, summaries) |
| HubSpot Sync | `~/clawd/data/hubspot-sync.db` | Cached HubSpot deals (with owner, type, description) and contacts (email, name, company, jobtitle, phone, lifecycle stage) with paginated sync |
| Beehiiv Sync | `~/clawd/data/beehiiv-sync.db` | Cached Beehiiv publication stats (daily subscriber snapshots) and post performance (open/click rates, recipients, unsubscribes) |
| Asana Sync | `~/clawd/data/asana-sync.db` | Cached Asana tasks (with assignee, notes, tags, section) used by business meta-analysis sync jobs and `scripts/action-items-briefing.js` |
| Knowledge Base | `skills/knowledge-base/data/knowledge.db` | RAG content with embeddings (~15 sources) |
| Financials | `skills/financials/data/financials.db` | Financial data: transactions, accounts, generated P&L and Balance Sheet reports. Tables: reports, accounts, transactions, invoices, bills, sync_log |
| Interactions | `~/clawd/data/interactions.db` | Centralized store of all API calls and LLM interactions with full request/response bodies. Tables: `llm_calls`, `api_calls`. Archived monthly by `log-rotation.js`. |
| Structured Logs | `~/clawd/data/logs.db` | Query-friendly mirror of both unified structured JSONL logs (`structured_logs` table) and OpenClaw gateway raw logs (`gateway_log_lines` table). Populated nightly by `tools/log-ingest.js` and `tools/gateway-log-ingest.js`. |
| Model Usage | `~/.openclaw/logs/model-usage.jsonl` | API usage and cost tracking (JSONL, not SQLite) |
| X Research Cache | `skills/x-research-v2/data/cache/` | File-based search result cache (15-min TTL) |
| CRM Learning | `~/clawd/crm/data/learning.json` | Learned contact filtering patterns |
| Video Pitches Count | `~/clawd/data/video-pitches.db` | ~30 pitches tracked |
| Cron Log Runs | `~/clawd/data/cron-log.db` | ~325 runs logged |

**Backup:** Hourly via `backup-databases.sh` -> Google Drive ("OpenClaw Backups" folder), keeps last 7 backups with `manifest.json`. Backs up all workspace DB files (including `~/clawd/data/logs.db`) plus JSONL event logs from `~/clawd/data/logs/`, including unified stream `all.jsonl`.

**Log rotation:** Daily via `scripts/rotate-logs.sh` - rotates JSONL files over 50MB, archives interactions DB rows older than 90 days.

**Disk monitoring:** Weekly via `scripts/disk-space-check.sh` - alerts to Telegram if disk space drops below 20GB (warning) or 10GB (urgent).
