Now, assume yourself as a deep-thinking Chief AI Scientist and Innovator at OpenAI. Please help me conduct in-depth research into the most effective way to fine-tune the open-source Large Language Model (LLM) shown below. The aim is to assist a busy family doctor in a privately run clinic by enabling the AI to pre-screen patients by checking their medical history, which is stored in the clinic's medical records, and asking about their current symptoms. The AI will then produce a preliminary diagnosis report, which my experienced nurse can use to prioritise patients for my attention. The fine-tuned LLM will power my custom Medical Assistant AI Agent, which has a chat interface through which patients can interact. What fine-tuning techniques would you recommend for this use case? Could you also help me research and design the most appropriate fine-tuning pipeline, providing code examples? Also, could you help me look for the most suitable dataset for this training pipeline? Alternatively, could you help me design a sample template for a suitable dataset? Help me research a reliable training methodology/pipeline.
